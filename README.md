Pneumonia is a casual pathological condition and is categorized into many types with different etiologies. However, in order to examine and kill the illness proprly, there is an urgent need in identifying pneumonia infection and this is a highly specified work requiring a great deal of knowledge from specialized doctors. To identify the causes, to prevent pneumonia better, as well as save the human resources for hospitals, many researches did apply machine learning techniques on automatically classifying Chest X-ray images (CXR) to recognize whether the lungs are normal or pneumonia, whether the disease is viral pneumonia or bacteria pneumonia. In this work, we use Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) as a CXR classifier and achieve the accuracy of <b> 96.75% </b> in Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification dataset.
 
<b> Keywords: </b> <i>Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), Chest X-ray (CXR), Pneumonia, Classfication</i>

#### 1. Preprocessing
- Original CXR images would be resized into 224x224 resolution.
- Edge detection on resized CXR images.

#### 2. Graph Construction
- Pixels having grayscale intensity value of `128` is qualified as a node and feature of a node consists of the grayscale intensity of the corresponding pixels.
- Edge exists between 2 nodes representing neighboring pixels from original images.
- Node attributes, which are grayscale values, are normalized graph-wise.

#### 3. Architecture construction
- In this work, GCN convolutional layers are designed to exchange information toward each other the same as the mechanism in
message-passing neural network. 
- MPNN comprises of 2 primary steps: UPDATE and READOUT
  - <b> UPDATE: </b> Feature vectors h(v) of node v , ∀v ∈ V are sequentially updated via 2 minor phases: 
    - <i> Aggregation:</i> neighboring nodes features are synthesized into one feature vector  
    - <i> Update:</i> aggregated feature vector would be assigned to node v.      
  -> The update phase would be conducted for T iterations before moving to final step.
  - <b> READOUT: </b> The final graph is pooled via a Log-Softmax activation.

#### 4. Dataset 
To validate the applied method, we use ”Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification dataset” with 6114 CXR images.
